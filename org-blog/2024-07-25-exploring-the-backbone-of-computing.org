* Preamble

In the vast landscape of computing, operating systems play a crucial
role as the backbone of every digital device, orchestrating the
interaction between hardware and software. This article delves into
the fundamental definition of operating systems, exploring the various
types that power our technology. We journey through the history of
their creation, highlighting key milestones that have shaped the
evolution of computing. Finally, we focus on the Linux operating
system, a powerhouse in the world of open-source software, examining
its origins, growth, and impact on modern computing.

* What is Operating System

#+begin_src markdown

An operating system (OS) is a fundamental software component of a
computer system that manages hardware and software resources,
providing services for computer programs. Here's a detailed breakdown
of its key functions and components:

** **Basic Concepts and Functions:**
  - **Resource Management:** The OS manages hardware resources,
    including the CPU, memory, disk space, and input/output devices.
  - **User Interface:** It provides an interface for users to interact
    with the computer, commonly in the form of a graphical user
    interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI).
  - **Process Management:** The OS regulates the execution of
    processes, including task scheduling, creation, termination, and
    synchronization.
  - **Memory Management:** It handles allocation and deallocation of
    memory space, ensuring efficient and safe memory use.
  - **File System Management:** The OS organizes, stores, retrieves,
    and manages data on storage devices through a file system.
  - **Device Management:** The OS controls and interacts with hardware
    peripherals through device drivers.
  - **Security and Access Control:** It enforces security policies,
    user authentication, and access control to protect data and
    resources.

** **Examples of Operating Systems:**
  - **Windows:** Developed by Microsoft, widely used in personal
    computers.
  - **macOS:** Developed by Apple, primarily used in Mac computers.
  - **Linux:** An open-source OS with various distributions like
    Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS.
  - **Unix:** A multiuser, multitasking OS used in servers and
    workstations.
  - **Android:** Developed by Google, used in smartphones and tablets.
  - **iOS:** Developed by Apple for iPhones and iPads.
