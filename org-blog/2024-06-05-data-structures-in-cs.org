* Preamble

In computer science, a /data structure/ is a way of organizing and
storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used
efficiently.

* The Common Data Structures in Computer Science

- /Arrays/: A collection of elements of the same data type stored in
  contiguous memory locations;
- /Linked Lists/: A sequence of elements where each element points to
  the next one, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion;
- /Stacks/: A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First
  Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the
  top;
- /Queues/: A linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out
  (FIFO) principle, where elements are added to the end and removed
  from the front;
- /Hash Tables/: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash
  function, allowing for efficient lookup and insertion;
- /Trees/: A non-linear data structure where elements are organized in a
  hierarchical manner, often used for efficient storage and retrieval
  of data;
- /Graphs/: A non-linear data structure that represents a collection of
  nodes connected by edges, often used for modeling relationships
  between data;
- /Tries/: A type of tree data structure used for storing and retrieving
  data efficiently, particularly in applications involving strings;
- Heaps: A specialized tree-based data structure used for efficient
  sorting and priority queuing;
