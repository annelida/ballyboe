* Preamble
Python provides a rich set of built-in methods for specific data
types, enabling developers to perform various operations
efficiently. These methods are categorized across different data types
such as numeric, sequence, mapping, set, and others. Here's an
overview of the built-in methods for some common data types.

* Numeric Types (~int, float, complex~)

* Sequence Types (~list, tuple, range~)

* Mapping Type (~dict~)

* Set Types (~set, frozenset~)

* Text Sequence Type (~str~)
