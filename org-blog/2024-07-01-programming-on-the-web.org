* Preamble

* Definition of a Request in Networking

A /network request/ is a structured packet of data sent over a network
by a client (such as a web browser, application, or device) to a
server (such as a web server, database server, or other network
service). The request typically asks the server to perform an
operation or return specific information.

* Glossary

/URL/ stands for /Uniform Resource Locator/. It is a reference or
address used to locate resources on the internet, such as web pages,
files, or other resources. It typically consists of a protocol (such
as HTTP or HTTPS), a domain name (or IP address) of the server hosting
the resource, and additional path and parameters to specify the exact
location of the resource.

/DNS/ stands for Domain Name System. It is a decentralized naming
system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the
internet or a private network. DNS translates domain names (e.g.,
example.com) into IP addresses that computers need to locate and
communicate with each other on a network.

/Transmission Control Protocol/ (TCP) is a connection-oriented
protocol that facilitates the transmission of data between networked
devices. It ensures that data is delivered accurately and in the same
order it was sent.

/HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)/ is a protocol used for
transmitting hypertext (HTML) documents and other types of data
between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over a network,
primarily the Internet.

/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)/ is an extension of HTTP
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) that is used for secure communication
over a computer network, particularly the Internet. HTTPS uses
encryption protocols such as /SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)/ or /TLS
(Transport Layer Security)/ to encrypt the data exchanged between the
client (e.g., a web browser) and the server, ensuring that the data is
protected from eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle
attacks.

/SSH (Secure Shell)/ is a cryptographic network protocol used for
secure communication, remote login, and other secure network services
over an unsecured network. SSH provides a secure channel over an
unsecured network by encrypting the traffic between the client and the
server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data. It is commonly
used to access and manage remote servers and devices securely.


* Request/response cycle

- /Initiation/: The cycle begins when a client (e.g., a web browser)
  initiates a request, often triggered by a user action such as typing
  a URL, clicking a link, or submitting a form;
- /URL Parsing/: The client parses the URL to extract essential
  components, including the protocol (e.g., "http" or "https"), domain
  name (e.g., www.example.com), port number (if specified), path
  (e.g., /path/to/resource), query parameters (if any), and fragment
  identifier (e.g., #section);
- /DNS Resolution/: The client performs a DNS (Domain Name System)
  lookup to translate the domain name into the corresponding IP
  address of the web server.
- /TCP Connection/: The client establishes a TCP (Transmission Control
  Protocol) connection to the web server on the appropriate port
  (usually port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS). This connection
  provides a reliable channel for data transfer;
- /HTTP Request Composition/: The client constructs an HTTP request,
  which includes the following components:
  - /HTTP method/ (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that specifies the
    action to be performed;
  - /Request headers/ containing information about the client, the
    accepted content types, and other metadata;
  - The full URL, including the path, query parameters, and fragment
    identifie;
  - An optional request body for methods like POST and PUT, where data
    can be sent to the server.
- /Request Transmission/: The client sends the HTTP request to the web
  server over the established TCP connection;
- /Server Processing/: The web server receives and processes the HTTP
  request based on the method, URL, and request headers. Server-side
  scripts, applications, and databases may be involved in generating
  the response;
- /HTTP Response Composition/: The web server constructs an HTTP
  response, which includes the following components:
  - A status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) indicating the result
    of the request;
  - Response headers containing information about the server, caching
    instructions, and metadata;
  - The response body, which contains the requested resource (e.g.,
    HTML page, image, JSON data).
- /Response Transmission/: The web server sends the HTTP response back
  to the client over the same TCP connection;
- /Client Processing/: The client receives the HTTP response and
  processes it. This may involve parsing the HTML, fetching additional
  resources (stylesheets, scripts, images), and rendering the web
  page;
- /JavaScript Execution/: If the response contains JavaScript code, the
  client executes the code, allowing for dynamic interactions and
  updates on the web page;
- /Rendering/: The client renders the fully processed web page,
  displaying it to the user;
- /User Interaction/: The user can interact with the rendered web page,
  initiating further HTTP requests and continuing the cycle by
  clicking links, submitting forms, or interacting with web
  applications.


* Conclusion

This request/response cycle is a fundamental process in web
communication, enabling the retrieval and presentation of web
resources on the World Wide Web. Understanding this cycle is crucial
for optimizing web performance, troubleshooting issues, and building
efficient web applications.
** What is Request Data

 When a client (like a web browser) interacts with a Flask web
 application, it sends an HTTP request. This request can contain
 various types of data:
  - *Query Parameters:* Data included in the URL, e.g.,
    `http://example.com/search?query=flask`.
  - *Form Data:* Data submitted via an HTML form, usually using the
    POST method.
  - *JSON Data:* Raw JSON sent in the body of the request, often used
    in APIs.
  - *Headers:* Metadata about the request, like content type or user
    agent.

** The `request` Object

  Flask provides a special object called `request` that contains all the
  information about the incoming HTTP request. You can access different
  types of data through this object using specific methods and
  properties.
