* Preamble

Programming languages are the foundation of modern computing, bridging
the gap between human logic and machine execution. This article delves
into the origins and evolution of programming languages, uncovering
the key milestones and innovations that have shaped their
development. Additionally, I provide a beginner-friendly introduction
to Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages
today.

* What is a programming language, and what are its core components?

*A programming language* is a system of notation for writing computer
programs.

#+begin_src markdown
  A programming language is a formal set of instructions that can be
  used to produce various kinds of output, which usually involves
  creating software that performs specific tasks. Essentially, a
  programming language provides a means for humans to communicate with
  computers, allowing us to write programs that can be executed by the
  machine.

  The core components of a programming language include:

  - **Syntax:** This refers to the set of rules that defines the
    combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly
    structured programs in that language. Syntax dictates the proper
    arrangements of keywords, operators, and syntax elements like
    parentheses and semicolons.

  - **Semantics:** While syntax refers to the structure, semantics
    refers to the meaning of the constructs within the language. It
    defines what actions are performed when specific statements are
    executed.

  - **Lexical Structure:** This involves the set of basic symbols from
    which the language programs are constructed. This includes keywords,
    operators, identifiers, literals, and punctuation.

  - **Data Types:** These are the classifications of data items. Every
    programming language supports various data types, such as integers,
    floats, characters, strings, and more complex types like arrays and
    structures.

  - **Variables:** They are used to store data values. Variables in a
    programming language provide a way to label data for manipulation
    and use throughout a program.

  - **Operators:** These are symbols that specify which operations to
    perform on the data. Common operators include arithmetic operators
    (+, -, *, /), relational operators (==, !=, >, <), and logical
    operators (&&, ||, !).

  - **Control Structures:** These dictate the order in which statements
    and instructions are executed. Common control structures include
    loops (for, while), conditionals (if, else), and switch-case
    structures.

  - **Functions/Procedures:** These are reusable blocks of code that
    perform a specific task. Functions (or procedures) help in breaking
    down a program into manageable parts and allow code to be reused.

  - **Libraries/Modules:** These are collections of pre-written code
    that can be included in your programs to extend their functionality
    without having to rewrite code. They help in maintaining and
    organizing the code by providing common functionalities.

  - **Environment/Runtime:** The environment includes everything needed
    to write, compile, and execute programs. This might consist of an
    integrated development environment (IDE), a text editor, a compiler
    or interpreter, and debugger tools.

  Here is a basic example in Python to illustrate some of these
  components: ```org
  ,#+begin_src python
  # Variable Assignment
  x = 10 y = 5

  # Function Definition
  def add(a, b): # Perform addition and return result return a + b

  # Control Structure: Conditional
  if x > y: # Control Structure: Loop for i in range(3): # Function Call
      result = add(x, y) print(f"Addition result: {result}")
#+end_src
```

In this example:
- **Variables:** `x` and `y` are variables.
- **Function:** `add` is a function that takes two parameters and
  returns their sum.
- **Control Structures:** Includes an `if` statement and a `for` loop.
- **Operators:** `>` (greater than) is a relational operator used in
  the `if` statement.
- **Libraries/Modules:** The `print` function and the `range` function
  are part of Python's standard library.

This basic illustration covers the essential components of a
programming language and helps in understanding how these elements
work together to form executable programs.  #+end_src

* How do programming languages translate human-readable code into machine-readable instructions?
#+begin_src markdown
  Programming languages translate human-readable code into
  machine-readable instructions through a series of systematic steps
  involving compilation or interpretation (or sometimes a combination of
  both). This process generally involves several stages, such as lexical
  analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code
  generation.

  Here's a high-level overview of how this process works:

  ,*Compilation and Interpretation*

  1. **Compilation:** A compiler translates the entire source code of a
     program into machine code before executing it. This involves
     multiple intermediate steps and generates an executable file.
     - **Languages:** C, C++, Rust

  2. **Interpretation:** An interpreter translates the source code into
     machine code line-by-line and executes it immediately. There is no
     separate executable file generated.
     - **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Ruby

  Some languages, like Java, use a hybrid approach involving both
  compilation and interpretation:
  - **Java:** Source code is compiled into an intermediate bytecode by
    the Java Compiler (`javac`). This bytecode is then interpreted or
    just-in-time (JIT) compiled to machine code by the Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM) during execution.

  ,*Stages of Translation*

  ,**1. Lexical Analysis (Scanning)**
     - **Input:** Source code
     - **Output:** Tokens
     - **Description:** The lexical analyzer scans the source code and
  breaks it down into tokens, which are the smallest units of the
  language, like keywords, operators, identifiers, and literals.  ```org
  ,#+begin_src python
  # Python source code
  x = 10 + y

  # Tokens
  [Identifier(x), Assignment(=), Integer(10), Operator(+),
  Identifier(y)]
#+end_src
```

**2. Syntax Analysis (Parsing)**
   - **Input:** Tokens
   - **Output:** Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
   - **Description:** The syntax analyzer (parser) checks the tokens
     against the grammatical rules of the programming language to form
     a hierarchical structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
```org
#+begin_src python
# Example of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
AST:
    Assignment
      - Identifier (x)
      - Add
          - Integer (10)
          - Identifier (y)
#+end_src
```

**3. Semantic Analysis**
   - **Input:** AST
   - **Output:** Annotated AST (or Symbol Table)
   - **Description:** The semantic analyzer verifies the semantic
     consistency of the AST. This step involves checking variable
     declarations, type checking, and ensuring that the operations are
     semantically correct.
```org
#+begin_src python
# Example: Semantic analysis checks
# Ensure 'y' is declared and has a compatible type with the operation
#+end_src
```

**4. Optimization (Optional)**
   - **Input:** Annotated AST or Intermediate Representation (IR)
   - **Output:** Optimized IR
   - **Description:** The optimizer improves the IR or AST to make the
     code more efficient, without changing its behavior. This may
     involve removing redundant code, inlining functions, and other
     performance enhancements.
```org
#+begin_src python
# Example: Optimization
# Unoptimized code
for i in range(0, 1000):
    sum = 0
    sum += i

# Optimized code
# The loop isn't doing anything productive, so it might be removed.
#+end_src
```

**5. Code Generation**
   - **Input:** Optimized IR or AST
   - **Output:** Machine code or bytecode
   - **Description:** The code generator translates the optimized IR
     or AST into target machine code, often specific to a certain
     architecture (x86, ARM, etc.), or into an intermediate bytecode
     (for languages like Java and Python).
```org
#+begin_src python
# Example: Machine code (conceptual)
MOV R1, 10
ADD R1, y

# Java bytecode example
0: iconst_10
1: istore_1
2: iload_2
3: iload_1
4: iadd
5: istore_1
#+end_src
```

**6. Linking (for compiled languages)**
   - **Input:** Machine code
   - **Output:** Executable file
   - **Description:** The linker combines various machine code files
     and libraries into a single executable file and resolves
     references between them.
```org
#+begin_src python
# Example: Linking in C/C++
# Combines object files (main.o, utils.o) into final executable (program.exe)
#gcc main.o utils.o -o program.exe
#+end_src
```

A *programming paradigm* is a method or style of programming that
defines a set of principles, techniques, and patterns for structuring
code to solve problems on a computer. Programming paradigms can be
classified into different categories, such as: Imperative
paradigm. Declarative paradigm. Object-oriented paradigm.

#+begin_quote
In *object-oriented* programming language a programming paradigm based
on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of
fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of
procedures, often known as methods. For example, a person is an object
which has certain properties such as height, gender, age, etc.

** What are the components of a Python programming language?

- /Character Set/: The character set in Python includes letters (A-Z or
  a-z), digits (0-9), special symbols (such as ., @, #, %, etc.), and
  white spaces (like blank space, horizontal tab, carriage return, new
  line, and form feed);
- /Data Types/: Python supports various data types, which are the types
  of values that can be stored and manipulated in a program. The
  type() function is used to get the data type of any object or
  variable;
- /Constants/: are fixed values that remain unchanged during the
  execution of a program and are used in assignment statements;
- /Variables/: are data items whose values may vary during the
  execution of the program;
- /Keywords/: are words that have been assigned specific meanings in
  the context of Python language programs and should not be used as
  variable names to avoid problems. There are 35 keywords in the
  Python programming language;
- /Expressions/: are phrases of code that Python evaluates to produce
  a value;
- /Statements/: are logical units of code that can be executed by the
  Python interpreter. They can be assignment statements, conditional
  statements, loops, or function calls;
- /Comments/: are additional readable information that is ignored by the
  Python interpreter. They begin with the # symbol and end with the
  end of the physical line;
- /Functions/: are blocks of code that can be called multiple times from
  different parts of a program;
- /Blocks and identation/: Python uses indentation to mark blocks of
  code. This is a distinctive feature of Python and is used to define
  the scope of control structures like if-else statements and loops;
- /Operators/: are symbols or keywords that perform mathematical,
  logical, or comparison operations on data;
- /Control Structures/: are used to control the flow of a Python
  program. They include conditionals (if-else statements), loops
  (for/while statements), and exceptions (try/except blocks.


** What is Python programming language?

#+begin_quote
/Python/ is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level /programming
language/ with dynamic semantics.
#+end_quote

** What is interpretation in programming?

#+begin_quote
/Interpretation/ in programming refers to the process where a computer
program, known as an interpreter, directly executes instructions
written in a programming or scripting language without the need for
prior compilation into machine code.
#+end_quote

** What is compilation in programming?

#+begin_quote
/Compilation/ in programming refers to the process of translating a
program written in a high-level programming language, known as source
code, into object code that a computer can understand.
#+end_quote

** Is Python interpreted or compiled programming language?

Python is both an interpreted and compiled language.

In /Interprereted Programming Language/ the source code is executed by
an interpreter which translates code into machine code on the fly.

/Compilation/ is the process of translating source code written in a
high-level programming language into a lower-level language, such as
machine code, that can be executed by a computer.

Python allows you to save the compiled bytecode to .pyc files. This
speeds up startup time on subsequent runs since the source code
doesn't need to be recompiled. When you are execute any Python script
the =.pyc= (compiled bytecode file) generated. If you run the script
again (without making changes) =.pyc= file will not be
regenerated. After execution modified script =.pyc= the file will be
generated again. Compilation carried out to increase the speed of
program execution.

/Python keywords/ are reserved words in the Python programming
language that have special meanings and purposes. These keywords
cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other

* The Programming Pillars:

Input/Output
Assignment
Comparison operations
Control flow operations
Procedures
Miscelellaneous

** What means =input/output= in Python?

#+begin_quote
Input/Output (I/O) in Python refers to the process of taking input
from the user or external sources and displaying output to the user or
saving it to a file.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
There are no specific keywords in Python dedicated solely for
input/output (I/O) operations. Python's I/O functionality is primarily
handled using built-in functions like ~input()~ and ~print()~ rather
than reserved keywords.
#+end_quote

** What means =assignment= in Python?

#+begin_quote
In Python, assignment refers to the process of binding a name to a
value or object.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Python's assignment functionality is primarily handled using the
assignment operator (=) and various augmented assignment operators
like +=, -=, *=, etc.

The /keywords/ that are most closely related to assignment in Python
are:

~del~: Used to delete a variable or remove elements from a list,
tuple, or dictionary;

~global~: Used to declare a variable as global inside a function;

~nonlocal~: Used to declare a variable as non-local inside a nested
function.
#+end_quote

** What means =comparison= operation in Python?

#+begin_quote
Comparison operations in Python refer to the use of comparison or
relational operators to compare variables or values. These operators
are essential in Python for making decisions based on conditions and
for controlling the flow of a program.

Python comparison operators include:
== (Equal to): Returns true if the two operands are equal.

!= (Not equal to): Returns true if the two operands are not equal.

> (Greater than): Returns true if the value of the left operand is
greater than the right operand.

< (Less than): Returns true if the value of the left operand is less
than the right operand.

>= (Greater than or equal to): Returns true if the value of the left
operand is greater or equal to the right operand.

<= (Less than or equal to): Returns true if the value of the left
operand is less or equal to the right operand.
#+end_quote

** What is =control flow operations= in programming?

/Control flow/ is the /order/ in which individual statements,
instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed
or evaluated.

Python provides several control flow constructs:

Conditional statements:

- ~if~ statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is True;
- ~if-else~ statement: Executes one block of code if a condition is
  True, and another block if it's False;
- ~if-elif-else~ statement: Allows checking multiple conditions.

Loops:

- ~for~ loop: Iterates over a sequence (like a list or string);
- ~while~ loop: Executes a block of code as long as a condition is
  True.

Transfer statements:

- ~break~ statement: Terminates the current loop and resumes execution
  at the next statement;
- ~continue~ statement: Skips the current iteration of a loop and
  moves to the next iteration.

The ~pass~ statement:

The body of a Python compound statement cannot be empty — it must
contain at least one statement. The ~pass~ statement, which performs
no action, can be used as a placeholder when a statement is
syntactically required but you have nothing specific to do.

Exception handling statements:

Python supports exception handling with the ~try~ statement, which
includes ~try~, ~except~, ~finally~, and ~else~ clauses.

** What is =procedures= in Python?

In Python, "procedures" typically refer to functions that perform
specific tasks or operations. Procedures (or functions)
are fundamental building blocks that allow you to encapsulate code
into reusable and modular units.

These keywords enable the creation and manipulation of functions:

~def~: Used to define a function;

~return~: Used to return a value from a function;

~yield~ Is a powerful tool for creating generators. It's used when you
need to iterate over a sequence of values efficiently

* Data model
** Objects, values and types

/Objects/ are Python’s abstraction for data.  All data in a Python
program is represented by objects or by relations between objects.

Every object has an identity, a type and a value.

*** Object identity

Object identity refers to the unique integer value that identifies an
object. This identity is unique during the lifetime of the object and
remains constant throughout its lifetime. It can be thought of as the
object's address in memory.

~is~ operator compares the identity of two objects; the ~id()~
function returns an integer representing its identity.

#+begin_src python :results output
  a = 10
  b = 15
  print(id(a))
  print(id(b))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 10861480
: 10861640

#+begin_src python :results output
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  b = a
  c = [1, 2, 3]
  print(a is b)
  print(a is c)
  print(a == c)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: True
: False
: True

Use ~is~ to check if two variables reference the same object;
Use == to check if two variables have the same value.

*** An object's type and value

An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports
and also defines the possible values for objects of that type.
~type()~ function returns an object’s type. Like its identity, an
object’s ‘type’ is also unchangeable.

The ‘value’ of some objects can change. Objects whose value can change
are said to be /mutable/; objects whose value is unchangeable once
they are created are called /immutable/. Numbers, strings and tuples
are /immutable/, while dictionaries and lists are /mutable/.

Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called
/containers/. Examples of containers are tuples, lists and
dictionaries.

#+begin_src python :results output
  my_list = [
    "hello",
    42,
    3,56,
    [1, 2, 3],
    {'key': 'value'}
    ]
  print(my_list)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ['hello', 42, 3, 56, [1, 2, 3], {'key': 'value'}]

***  A list of types that are built into Python

- /None/: It is used to signify the absence of a value in many
  situations, e.g., it is returned from functions that don’t
  explicitly return anything;
- /NotImplemented/: Numeric methods and rich comparison methods should
  return this value if they do not implement the operation for the
  operands provided;
- /Ellipsis/: This object is accessed through the literal ‘...’ or the
  built-in name ‘Ellipsis’;
- /Number/: These are created by numeric literals and returned as
  results by arithmetic operators and arithmetic built-in functions.
  Numeric objects are immutable;

****  Numbers in Python

Python supports three types of numbers: /integers, floats and complex/
numbers. These types are used to represent numeric data in Python
programming.

- /Integers/ (int) are whole numbers, including negative numbers but
  not fractions. These represent numbers in an unlimited range.  The
  /Boolean/ (bool) type is a subtype of the integer type. These
  represent the truth values /False/ and /True/.
- /Float/ (float) are real numbers with a fractional part denoted by
  the decimal symbol or the scientific notation.
- /Complex/ (complex) store the real and imaginary parts as floats by
  default.

  Type Conversion:


- ~int()~ Function converts a string or float to an integer;

- ~float()~ Function converts a string or integer to a float;

- ~complex()~ Function converts a string or float to a complex number;

  Operations:

- /Arithmetic Operations/: Integers and floats support basic
  arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication,
  and division;

- /Modulus/: The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the
  division operation;

- /Exponentiation/: The exponentiation operator (***) raises a number
  to a power;

- /Absolute Value/: The ~abs()~ function returns the absolute value of
  a number.

  Built-in Functions:

  - ~math~ module: provides functions like ~sqrt()~, ~exp()~ and
    ~pi()~ for mathematical operations;

    #+begin_src python :results output
      import math
      print(math.pi)
      print(math.e)
      print(math.exp(10))

    : 2.718281828459045
    : 22026.465794806718

  - ~max()~ and ~min()~ functions: return the maximum and minimum
    values of a set of numbers.

    #+begin_src python :results output
      numbers = [4, 12, 43.3, 19, 100]
      print("Minimum:", min(numbers))
      print("Maximum:", max(numbers))

    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : Minimum: 4
    : Maximum: 100
