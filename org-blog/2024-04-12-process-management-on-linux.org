* Introduction

#+begin_quote
A process in Linux is nothing but a program in execution. It’s a
running instance of a program. Any command that you execute starts a
process.

Occasionally processes may consume a lot of resources and need to be
killed. Alternatively, times when you may want to change the priority
level of a process, so the system will allocate more resources to it.
All these tasks require you to do the same thing: listing the running
processes on Linux.

** Types of processes in Linux

Foreground Processes - depend on the user for input also referred to
as interactive processes;

Background Processes - run independently of the user referred to as
non-interactive or automatic processes.

** Process' states in Linux

Running:
A process in running state means that it is running or it’s
ready to run.

Sleeping (interruptible sleep, uninterruptible sleep): When it is
waiting for a resource to be available. A process in Interruptible
sleep will wakeup to handle signals, whereas a process in
Uninterruptible sleep will not.

Stopped:
When it receives a stop signal.

Zombie
When a process is dead but the entry for the process is
still present in the table.

** Commands for Process Management in Linux

There are several commands available in Linux to track running
processes. These commands are =Top=, =htop= and =ps=.

** The =top= command for mananging Linux processes
#+begin_src sh
  top
#+end_src

PID: Unique Process ID given to each process;
User: Username of the process owner;
PR: Priority given to a process while scheduling;

NI: ‘nice’ value of a process: a negative nice value means higher
priority, whereas a positive nice value means lower priority.Zero in
this field simply means priority will not be adjusted in determining a
task's dispatch-ability

VIRT: Amount of virtual memory used by a process;
RES: Amount of physical memory used by a process;
SHR: Amount of memory shared with other processes;
S: state of the process;

  - ‘D’ = uninterruptible sleep
  - 'I' = Idle
 - ‘R’ = running
 - ‘S’ = sleeping
 - ‘T’ = traced or stopped
 - ‘Z’ = zombie

%CPU: Percentage of CPU used by the process;
%MEM; Percentage of RAM used by the process;
TIME+: Total CPU time consumed by the process;
Command: Command used to activate the process;

** The =htop=
It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and
horizontally and use the functional keys.

#+begin_example
F3, /
Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed processes.
The currently selected (highlighted) command will update as you type.
While in search mode, pressing F3 will cycle through matching
occurrences.

F4, \
Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line
and only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel filtering,
enter the Filter option again and press Esc.
#+end_example

** ps (Process Status) command

It displays the currently-running processes. However, unlike the top
command, the output generated is not in realtime.

#+begin_src sh
  ps
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 904296 ?        00:00:01 systemd
 904299 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
 904327 ?        00:22:33 pipewire
 904329 ?        00:00:33 wireplumber
 904330 ?        00:37:35 pipewire-pulse
 904336 ?        00:00:00 gnome-keyring-d
 904339 ?        00:00:05 dbus-daemon
 +end_example

 PID  process ID
 TTY  terminal type
 TIME  total time the process has been running
 CMD  name of the command that launches the process

 To get more information using ps command use:

#+begin_src sh
ps -u
#+end_src

%CPU represents the amount of computing power the process is taking.
%MEM represents the amount of memory the process is taking up.
STAT represents process state

While ps command only displays the processes that are currently
running, you can also use it to list all the processes.

#+begin_src sh
ps -A
#+end_src

You can use =ps aux= to get more in-depth information about your
running processes.

- a option outputs all running processes of all users in the system;
- u option provides additional information like memory and CPU usage
  percentage, the process state code, and the owner of the processes;
- x option lists all processes not executed from the terminal. A
  perfect example of this are daemons, which are system-related
  processes that run in the background when the system is booted up.

  #+begin_src sh
    ps -aux | grep ssh
