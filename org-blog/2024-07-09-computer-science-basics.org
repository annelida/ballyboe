* Preamble

Computer science is the study of computers and computational
systems. It encompasses theoretical studies of algorithms, data
structures, and the fundamental principles of computer operation, as
well as practical applications in software development, system
design, and artificial intelligence. Computer science is an
interdisciplinary field that integrates aspects of mathematics,
engineering, and even cognitive sciences to solve complex problems
and innovate new technologies.
