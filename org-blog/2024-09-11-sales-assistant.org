* Cover Letter

My name is Viktoriia Kosinova and I am really interested in applying
for the Sales Assistant role at EUROSPAR.

I am an experienced store manager, with over 14 years of experience in
managing large volumes of stock and manage teams in busy retail
environments.

While working as a Store Manager with an Alcohol and Wine store in
Ukraine, I ensured high levels of customer service, monitored stock
levels, placed orders and negotiated prices with suppliers, handled
customer complaints and trained in new staff.

I really like to communicate with people, and excel at problem
solving. I am really good at building relationships, and I take a
personal approach with each customer. It always gives me great joy and
I am filled with pride when customers return again and again to our
store.

I am really interested in this opportunity as I would like to work in
an busy and growing company like yours. I hope that my great
experience will contribute to the continued success of your store.

I am available for interview at any time that is convenient for you. I
look forward to hearing from you. If you have any questions, please do
not hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully,
Viktoriia Kosinova
