* Introduction

/A compiler/ is a crucial software tool that typically translates
source code written in high-level programming languages (like as C,
C++, Java, or Python) into low-level languages like assembly or
machine code to create an executable program for computer's processor.

It performs tasks like error detection, syntax analysis, and
optimization to ensure the code is well-formed and optimized for the
hardware being used.

* A detailed description of the compilation process

Here's a more detailed description of what a compiler does:

- /Lexical Analysis/: The compiler reads the source code and converts it
  into a stream of tokens.

  /Tokens/ are basic language elements like keywords, operators,
  identifiers, and symbols;

- /Syntax Analysis (Parsing)/: The stream of tokens is analyzed to
  ensure that they follow the grammatical structure of the programming
  language. This phase produces a parse tree or syntax tree,
  representing the hierarchical structure of the source code;

- /Semantic Analysis/: The compiler checks the syntax tree for
  semantic errors, such as type mismatches, undeclared variables, and
  other logical errors. This ensures that the code makes sense within
  the context of the language's rules;

- /Intermediate Code Generation/: The compiler translates the syntax
  tree into an intermediate representation (IR), which is a low-level
  code that is easier to optimize and convert into machine code;

- /Optimization/: The intermediate code is optimized to improve
  performance and efficiency. This can involve removing redundant
  code, improving memory usage, and optimizing execution speed;

- /Code Generation/: The optimized intermediate code is then
  translated into machine code or bytecode, depending on the target
  platform. Machine code is specific to the computer's architecture,
  while bytecode is typically used for virtual machines;

- /Code Linking/: If the program consists of multiple modules or
  libraries, the compiler links them together to create a single
  executable file.
