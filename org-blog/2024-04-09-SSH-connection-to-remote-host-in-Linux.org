* Introduction

 *ssh (SSH client)* is a program for logging into a remote machine and
 for executing commands on a remote machine. It is intended to provide
 secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an
 insecure network.

 SSH works by connecting a client program to an ssh server, called
 sshd.

 *sshd (OpenSSH Daemon)* is the daemon program for ssh. It provides
 secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an
 insecure network.

 When a secure SSH connection is established, a shell session
 starts. It enables manipulating the remote machine (server) by typing
 commands within the client on your local computer.


* Prerequisites

- The remote computer must be turned on and have a network connection;

- The SSHd program must be running;

- You must to know the IP address or the name of the remote machine;

- You must to have permission to access the remote computer;

- You must to know user's name and password for logging.

#+begin_src sh
  ssh UserName@IPAddressOrHostname
#+end_src

* How to verify that SSH server is running

#+begin_src sh
  ps -aux | grep sshd
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src sh
  systemctl status ssh
#+end_src


The process needed to start an ssh server depends on the distribution
of Linux that you are using. In Debian12 you can manually start it by
running:

#+begin_src sh
  sudo service ssh start
#+end_src

To stop the SSH host server, enter the following:

#+begin_src 
  sudo service ssh stop
#+end_src

* SSH port

SSH, by default, is configured to use port 22 for remote
communication. Note that itâ€™s possible to configure a different port
for SSH.
