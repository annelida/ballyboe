  Part I "The neuroscience solution to boredom "

  Sometimes during our learning process it is difficult to focus and
  remember studying material.The reason why our brain works so bad in
  particular situationsis because the new information can be not
  interesting for us or too hard or boring. Scientific research has proven
  that our brain in the studying process tries to search for rewards.
  And in cases when rewards are non-obvious our brain doesn't know how
  to progress.
  To solve this trouble the scientists offer to change our direction of
  thinking.
  Instead of traditional searching rewards in our learning process,
  just try to seek novelty.
 
  And think about the novelty, new knowledge as your rewards.

  Reverse approach: use the working sample with minimum modifications

- Note taken on [2023-10-11 Wed 17:05] \\
  * Prerequisites
  I have two repositories:
  - The first -  working properly
  - The second - new, not working.
  - Core samples with brief description how it shold work

    The task: *Modificate the content of not working repo and force it
    work properly as the first one*

    The average workflow:
    1. Core samples reading till full clarification the idea behind
       these words;

    2. Find differences among these two repos. It's not difficult by
       /diff/ utility in Bash or the same in Emacs;

    3. To ponder aroun what is should be changed, why and how?

    4. Elaborate a clear hypothesis how to make changes to achieve the
       result.

* TODO Comparing files and folders in Linux/Emacs
SCHEDULED: <2023-10-17 Tue>
- Note taken on [2023-10-15 Sun 08:13] \\

  In Emacs:

  The command M-x diff prompts for two file names, using the minibuffer,
  and displays the differences between the two files in a buffer
  named *diff*.
  [[info:emacs#Comparing Files][emacs#Comparing Files]]

  A (much more sophisticated) alternative is M-x ediff
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html][Ediff]]

  In Linux terminal:

  To find diff use this command:

  diff -qr dir1/ dir2/
  -r will diff all subdirectories too
  -q tells diff to report only when files differ.

  diff  --brief dir1/ dir2/
  --brief will show the files that dosent exist
  in directory.

  Meld is also a great tool for comparing two directories:

  meld dir1/ dir2/
  Meld has many options for comparing files or directories.
  If two files differ, it's easy to enter file comparison mode
  and see the exact differences.

  Create two files with some difference and compare them using
  each possible approach.
  Put the files in folders with the same name and compare again.
  
:LOGBOOK:

CLOCK: [2023-10-15 Sun 08:13]--[2023-10-15 Sun 09:23] =>  1:10
:END:

To compare two files and two folders with files I spent several
simple tests.

For the test I used Emacs's diff and ediff functions.
Also I used the diff command in the Linux terminal.

Test 1.
I created a folder /test and put inside two absolutely similar files:
file1.txt and file2.txt.
The files have the same content.
When I run M-x diff function and put the file's name.

Result:
Diff finished (no differences).  Mon Oct 16 12:18:47 2023

The ediff function result was the same.
But results were shown in different ways.

In the Linux terminal I run the command:
$diff -u file1.txt file2.txt
-u output NUM (default 3) lines of unified context

Command executed, but no results didn't shown in this case.

Test 2.
I added three lines with changes to file2.txt and ran
M-x diff again.
The changes were shown in a separate  buffer (it's name diff)
with highlights. 

Emac's ediff function works the same way. But I prefer diff function
result presentations.

In Linux terminal I run again:
$ diff -u file1.txt file2.txt
As result lines with changes were shown.

Test 3
I created folder /dir1 and /dir2 inside my folder /tests and put where
two of the same files with same name (file1.txt).

When run M-x diff.

When I put file2.txt  into folder dir2 and run M-x diff in my Emacs:

Result:

vikky@penguin:~/tests$ diff -u dir1 dir2
Only in dir2: file2.txt

Test 4
I edited file1.txt in dir2 and ran M-x diff in Emacs
(I wrote the path to each file):

Result:
I saw only the differences between the two files. Differences
between two folders are not shown.

In the Linux terminal i used the command:
vikky@penguin:~/tests$ diff -a -y dir1 dir2
-a treat all lines as text;
-y output in two columns;
As a result I saw  not only the difference between two files, but the
difference between the two folders also:
Only in dir2: file2.txt

Conclusions for 17/10/2023:
In Emacs using M-x diff function it not necessary to separately compare folders and whe files.
You can see full result in diff buffer.
In the Linux terminal it is possible at the same time to compare folder with files:
$ diff -a -y dir1 dir2
