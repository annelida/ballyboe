  Part I "The neuroscience solution to boredom "

  Sometimes during our learning process it is difficult to focus and
  remember studying material.The reason why our brain works so bad in
  particular situationsis because the new information can be not
  interesting for us or too hard or boring. Scientific research has proven
  that our brain in the studying process tries to search for rewards.
  And in cases when rewards are non-obvious our brain doesn't know how
  to progress.
  To solve this trouble the scientists offer to change our direction of
  thinking.
  Instead of traditional searching rewards in our learning process,
  just try to seek novelty.
 
  And think about the novelty, new knowledge as your rewards.

- Note taken on [2023-10-11 Wed 17:05] \\
  * Prerequisites
  I have two repositories:
  - The first -  working properly
  - The second - new, not working.
  - Core samples with brief description how it shold work

    The task: *Modificate the content of not working repo and force it
    work properly as the first one*

    The average workflow:
    1. Core samples reading till full clarification the idea behind
       these words;

    2. Find differences among these two repos. It's not difficult by
       /diff/ utility in Bash or the same in Emacs;

    3. To ponder aroun what is should be changed, why and how?

    4. Elaborate a clear hypothesis how to make changes to achieve the
       result.

1. I compared the list of folders and files for two repositories:
0--key.github.io with annelida.github.io

Only annelida.github.io has:
_site
Gemfile.lock
index.md

Only 0--key.github.io has files:
screenshot.png
old_index.md

Using M-x diff compared:
index.md (from annelida.github.io)
old_index.md (from 0--key.github.io)

Result:
diff -u /home/vikky/git/annelida.github.io/index.md /home/vikky/git/0--key.github.io/old_index.md                                                                                                                                          1. I compared the content of two repositories:

2. I compared the root folders from two repositories
0--key.github.io and annelida.github.io file by file.

Differences are in files:

_config.yml

The line are different:
title:
tagline:
author:
name:
email:
github:
production_url:
short_name:
tracking_id:

Gemfile

Only in annelida.github.io/Gemfile:
gem "kramdown-parser-gfm"
gem "minima"

Only in annelida.github.io there is a file:
Gemfile.lock

3. Comparing two repositories folder by folder:
Differences only in content of /_includes/themes folder and /assets/themes folder.
Differences in each file in _/layouts folder 

diff 0--key.github.io/_includes/themes/ annelida.github.io/_includes/themes/
Common subdirectories: 0--key.github.io/_includes/themes/bootstrap-3 and annelida.github.io/_includes/themes/bootstrap-3
Common subdirectories: 0--key.github.io/_includes/themes/twitter and annelida.github.io/_includes/themes/twitter
Only in 0--key.github.io/_includes/themes/: hooligan

diff 0--key.github.io/assets/themes/ annelida.github.io/assets/themes/
Common subdirectories: 0--key.github.io/assets/themes/bootstrap and annelida.github.io/assets/themes/bootstrap
Common subdirectories: 0--key.github.io/assets/themes/css and annelida.github.io/assets/themes/css
Common subdirectories: 0--key.github.io/assets/themes/twitter and annelida.github.io/assets/themes/twitter
Only in 0--key.github.io/assets/themes/: hooligan

4. Comparing /_layouts folders file by file:

Folder /layouts for both repositories contains the same files:
default.html
page.html
post.html
 
The difference is one and common for this files:

 ---
 theme :
-  name : bootstrap-3   (annelida.github.io)
+  name : hooligan      (0--key.github.io)
 ---
At first I wanted to change the look of my blog.To understand the concept
of how Jekyll works I compared my new repository annelida.github.io that
had theme bootstrap-3 by default and another properly working
repository 0--key.github.io.

The second repository has configurations for the theme "hooligan".
I compared these two repositories folder by folder and file by file.
Using [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/][Jekyll's official documentation]] I understood that if you place images,
css, js in folder /assets they will be used across your site.

The 'include' tag allows you to include the content from another file stored
in the _includes folder. In my case I need to include content of files:
default.html
page.html
post.html
to the corresponding files from /_layouts folder.

  A Python module is a file that has a .py extension, and a Python
  package is any folder that has modules inside it.

  Relative imports in Python 3 allow you to import modules
  or functions from other packages within your package hierarchy.

  To use relative imports, you need to use the from . import syntax.
  The number of dots before the import statement represents the number
  of package levels you need to go up to reach the desired module or
  function.

  A unit test is a smaller test, that checks
  that a single component operates in the right way.

  An integration test checks that components in your
  application operate with each other.

  A unit test checks a small component in your application.

  The three most popular test runners are:

  unittest
  nose or nose2
  pytest

  unittest requires that:

  You put your tests into classes as methods
  You use a series of special assertion methods
  in the unittest.TestCase class instead of the
  built-in assert statement

  I had problems with running Python3 code using org-babel.
  At first when I run my code I saw the error:
  "Program Python is not found."

  I fixed this error when I installed the package "python-is-python3" on my Debian:

  $  apt-get install python-is-python3

  Is a package which makes Python 3 become the default version in Ubuntu/Debian instead of Python 2.

  The second problem was that my output was always "None" when I run my code.
  My source code block looked:

  #+begin_src python
  print("hello")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : None

  I fixed it when added :results output

  #+begin_src python :results output
  print("hello")
  #+end_src
  #+RESULTS:
  : hello

  A branch is an independent development line containing a pointer
   — or the branch head — to the most recent commit in the code.
  A single Git repository can track many branches, but your working
  tree centers on just one. The head points to the tip (the latest commit)
  of a branch.
  In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.

  Let's say you have a large project, and you need to update
  the design on it.

  With a new branch called NEW-DISIGN, edit the code directly without
  impacting the main branch.

  Let’s say that at the same time an error was discovered in the
  project that requires be urgent fixed.

  Create a new branch from the main project called ERROR-FIX.
  Fix the error and merge the ERROR-FIX branch with
  the main branch.

  When go back to the NEW_DESIGN branch, and finish the work there.
  Merge the NEW-DISIGN branch with main.

  $ git checkout -  command used to check out a branch
  $ git checkout -b - will create a new branch, and move to it.

  You can describe of the HEAD as the "current branch".
  When you switch branches

  $ git checkout

  the HEAD revision changes to point to the tip of the new branch.

  You can see what HEAD points to by doing:

  $ cat .git/HEAD

  ref: refs/heads/main

  Git tags description

  Tags are used as markers for significant points in the project timeline,
  whereas branches are separate lines of development that will eventually
  be merged back into the main application code.
  A tag is an object referencing a specific commit within the project history,
  similar to chapter markers in a book.
  This allows you to switch to the tagged version of the codebase to see what
  the code looked like when the tag was created and, if necessary,
  revert to that specific codebase version.

  $ git tag
  command allows to create, list, delete, and verify tags.

  Deleting a tag does not affect the code in your repository -
  it just removes the tag label.

  Both of these commands are designed to integrate changes
  from one branch into another branch. They just do it in very
  different ways.

  Merging is nice because it’s a non-destructive operation.
  The existing branches are not changed in any way. This avoids
  all of the potential pitfalls of rebasing.

  The major benefit of rebasing is that you get a much cleaner
  project history.

  The golden rule of git rebase is to never use it on public branches.
  (ie. never rebase master). You should never rebase master onto
  a feature branch.

SCHEDULED: <2023-11-15 Wed>

  In Emacs:

  The command M-x diff prompts for two file names, using the minibuffer,
  and displays the differences between the two files in a buffer
  named *diff*.
  [[info:emacs#Comparing Files][emacs#Comparing Files]]

  A (much more sophisticated) alternative is M-x ediff
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html][Ediff]]

  In Linux terminal:

  To find diff use this command:

  diff -qr dir1/ dir2/
  -r will diff all subdirectories too
  -q tells diff to report only when files differ.

  diff  --brief dir1/ dir2/
  --brief will show the files that dosent exist
  in directory.

  Meld is also a great tool for comparing two directories:

  meld dir1/ dir2/
  Meld has many options for comparing files or directories.
  If two files differ, it's easy to enter file comparison mode
  and see the exact differences.

  Create two files with some difference and compare them using
  each possible approach.
  Put the files in folders with the same name and compare again.

To compare two files and two folders with files I spent several
simple tests.

For the test I used Emacs's diff and ediff functions.
Also I used the diff command in the Linux terminal.

Test 1.
I created a folder /test and put inside two absolutely similar files:
file1.txt and file2.txt.
The files have the same content.
When I run M-x diff function and put the file's name.

Result:
Diff finished (no differences).  Mon Oct 16 12:18:47 2023

The ediff function result was the same.
But results were shown in different ways.

In the Linux terminal I run the command:
$diff -u file1.txt file2.txt
-u output NUM (default 3) lines of unified context

Command executed, but no results didn't shown in this case.

Test 2.
I added three lines with changes to file2.txt and ran
M-x diff again.
The changes were shown in a separate  buffer (it's name diff)
with highlights. 

Emac's ediff function works the same way. But I prefer diff function
result presentations.

In Linux terminal I run again:
$ diff -u file1.txt file2.txt
As result lines with changes were shown.

Test 3
I created folder /dir1 and /dir2 inside my folder /tests and put where
two of the same files with same name (file1.txt).

When run M-x diff.

Results: Diff finished (no differences).  Mon Oct 16 12:54:43 2023

When I put file2.txt  into folder dir2 and run M-x diff in my Emacs:

Result:
diff -u /home/vikky/tests/dir2 /home/vikky/tests/dir1
Only in /home/vikky/tests/dir2: file2.txt
Diff finished.  Mon Oct 16 13:07:00 2023

In the Linux terminal:
vikky@penguin:~/tests$ diff -u dir1 dir2
Only in dir2: file2.txt

Test 4
I edited file1.txt in dir2 and ran M-x diff in Emacs
(I wrote the path to each file):

Result:
I saw only the differences between the two files. Differences
between two folders are not shown.

In the Linux terminal i used the command:
vikky@penguin:~/tests$ diff -a -y dir1 dir2
-a treat all lines as text;
-y output in two columns;
As a result I saw  not only the difference between two files, but the
difference between the two folders also:
Only in dir2: file2.txt

Test 4
I edited file1.txt in dir2 and ran M-x diff in Emacs (I wrote the path
to each file):

Result:
I saw only the differences between the two files. Differences between
the two folders are not shown.

In the Linux terminal i used the command:
vikky@penguin:~/tests$ diff -a -y dir1 dir2
-a treat all lines as text;
-y output in two columns;

As a result I saw  not only the difference between the two files, but the difference between the two folders also:
Only in dir2: file2.txt
 
Conclusions for 17/10/2023:
In Emacs using M-x diff function it not necessary to separately compare folders and whe files.
You can see full result in diff buffer.
In the Linux terminal it is possible at the same time to compare folder with files:
$ diff -a -y dir1 dir2

  It is deliberately optimized for speed of development—its
  simple syntax, dynamic typing, lack of compile steps,
  and built-in toolset allow pro-grammers to develop programs in a fraction
  of the time needed when using some other
  tools.

  The net effect is that Python typically boosts developer productivity many times beyond the levels supported by traditional languages.


  Python’s built-in interfaces to operating-system services make it ideal for writing port-able, maintainable system-administration tools and utilities
  (sometimes called shell tools).
  Python programs can search files and directory trees,
  launch other programs, do parallel processing with processes and
  threads, and so on.

  Internet Scripting
  Python comes with standard Internet modules that allow Python programs
  to perform a wide variety of networking tasks, in client and server modes.
  Scripts can communicate over sockets; extract form information sent to
  server-side CGI scripts; transfer files by FTP; parse, generate, and analyzeXML files; send, receive, compose, and parse email;
  fetch web pages by URLs; parse the HTML and XML of fetched web pages; commu-
  nicate over XML-RPC, SO.

  Database Programming

  For traditional database demands, there are Python interfaces to all
  commonly used  ODBC, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.



  “script” -  a simpler top-level file.
  “program” to refer to a more sophisticated multifile application.
