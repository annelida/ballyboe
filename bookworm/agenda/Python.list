* ACTIVE Whetting Your Appetite

  * Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems,
  and will help you get the job done more quickly.
  * Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level
  language, it has high-level data types built in,
  such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.
  * Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in
  other Python programs.
  * It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the
  basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python.
  * Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during
  program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.
  * The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with
  features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during
  bottom-up program development.
  * Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably.

* RAW Using the Python Interpreter
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-04 Sat>
- Note taken on [2023-11-04 Sat 08:45] \\
  * The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3
  It possible to start it by typing the command:

  $ python

  * Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is
  an installation option, other places are possible:
  /usr/local/lib/python3 for example.

  * You can exit the interpreter by typing the following command:

  quit() or Ctrl+D

  * A second way of starting the interpreter is

  $ python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s)
  in command

  * Some Python modules are also useful as scripts.

  * These can be invoked using $ python -m module [arg] ...,

  which executes the source file for module as if you had spelled out its
  full name on the command line.

  * When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the
  script and enter interactive mode afterwards.
  This can be done by passing -i before the script.
