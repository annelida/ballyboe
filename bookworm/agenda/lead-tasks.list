  /Assistant/: Purpose-built AI that uses OpenAI’s models and calls
  tools;

  /Thread/: A conversation session between an Assistant and a
  user. Threads store Messages and automatically handle truncation to
  fit content into a model’s context;

  /Message/: A message created by an Assistant or a user. Messages can
  include text, images, and other files. Messages stored as a list on
  the Thread;

  /Run/: An invocation of an Assistant on a Thread. The Assistant uses
  its configuration and the Thread’s Messages to perform tasks by
  calling models and tools. As part of a Run, the Assistant appends
  Messages to the Thread;

  /Run Step/: A detailed list of steps the Assistant took as part of a
  Run. An Assistant can call tools or create Messages during its
  run. Examining Run Steps allows you to introspect how the Assistant is
  getting to its final results.

  An algorithm's time complexity of O(n) refers to a linear time
  complexity. This means that the running time of the algorithm
  increases linearly with the size of the input. In other words, the
  time taken by the algorithm to execute grows directly with the size of
  the input, and the time complexity is proportional to the input size.

  [[info:org#Using Header Arguments][org#Using Header Arguments]]
  https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html#Header-arguments

  The ~:tangle~ argument in Org-mode is used to extract code from your
  Org-mode documents and save it to an external file.

  #+begin_src python :results output :tangle example.py
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world")

    hello_world()
  #+end_src

  When you run the =M-x org-babel-tangle= command (usually bound to
  C-c C-v t), this code block will be extracted and saved into a file
  named ~example.py~ with the following content:

  #+begin_example
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world")

    hello_world()
  #+end_example

  #+begin_src python :results output pp
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world!")

    hello_world()
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello, world!

  The ~:session~ header argument in Org-mode is used to specify a
  shared session for executing code blocks within an Org
  document. ~:session~ header argument in Org-mode offers a powerful
  way to manage code execution environments across multiple source
  blocks. By sharing a session across multiple code blocks, you avoid
  the overhead of reinitializing the environment for each block,
  thereby improving the efficiency.

  #+begin_src python :session mysession :results none
    x = 10
    y = 20
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src python :results output :session mysession
    result = x + y
    print(result)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 30


- Take a look at 0--key/org-pub/2024-06-05-python-fundamentals.org;
- It uses :session and :tangle properties, check up the manual about
  properties in general and about these particular ones as well;
- The test suites are in the body with :results none (to suppress the
  output);
- The next code block evaluates the test suite above and uses the
  property :results output pp frome the file header;
- So, just evaluate the test suite first (C-c C-c inside the code block);
- After that your test suite is inside Babel session;
- So, unittest.main(exit=False) will produce the result of test suite
  evaluation and spit out the relevant results;
- Finally it is possible to launch unittests inside Babel without any
  tangling files at all.
