  with databases, making it
  unable to validate database-related functionalities.

  * Dynamic Web Applications: Selenium IDE struggles with handling
  dynamic components within web-based applications, potentially
  leading to inaccuracies in testing results.

  Selenium IDE doesnâ€™t offer built-in functionality to automatically
  capture screenshots when a test case fails, potentially hindering
  troubleshooting.
