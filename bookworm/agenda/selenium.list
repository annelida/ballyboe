* ACTIVE [#A] What is Selenium?
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-07 Tue>
- Note taken on [2023-10-30 Mon 10:08] \\
  Selenium is Open source test automation tool that provides API/Libraries
  to automate the tests; in turn, it simulates the actions on the browser.
* Components of Selenium
* ACTIVE [#A] What is Selenium WebDriver?
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-07 Tue>
- Note taken on [2023-10-30 Mon 10:15] \\
  Allows direct communication 
  with the browser.
  Selenium WebDriver component provides libraries to automate the browser.
  It accepts the commands, processes, and actions on the browser.
* Selenium for Web Automation
* Locators and Handling Web Elements
* ACTIVE Synchronization, Exception Handling and Assertions
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-04 Sat>
- Note taken on [2023-11-04 Sat 10:20] \\
  Selenium WebDriver offers implicit wait, and explicit wait to address
  the synchronization exceptions.
 
  Synchronization is when two or more components work together 
  to perform any action, the components need to run in sync to achieve
  the expected output.

  Synchronization can be classified into 
  two categories – Unconditional Synchronization (Static Wait)
  and Conditional Synchronization (Dynamic wait).

* Hybrid Application Automation & Launching Multiple Apps
* Selenium Automation Framework – Part 1
* Selenium Automation Framework – Part 2
* Dockerized Selenium Grid
* ACTIVE [#A] What is Selenium Grid?
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-07 Tue>
- Note taken on [2023-10-30 Mon 10:13] \\
  Selenium Grid helps to run the test on multiple machines.
  If you have a specific requirement to run a test against multiple
  browsers and operating systems, consider integrating the Selenium Grid.
* ACTIVE [#A] What is Selenium IDE?
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-07 Tue>
- Note taken on [2023-10-30 Mon 10:17] \\
  Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a record and
  playback tool.
  It is available as a browser extension or plugin. Selenium IDE helps
  beginners and manual testers to learn more efficiently.
 
* ACTIVE [#A] Features of Selenium IDE
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-07 Tue>
TODO [#A] Benefits of Using Selenium IDE
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-07 Tue>
* ACTIVE [#A] Limitations of Selenium IDE
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-07 Tue>
- Note taken on [2023-10-31 Tue 09:28] \\
  * Limited Data Testing: Selenium IDE might not be
  ideal for testing scenarios involving extensive
  datasets, making it less suitable for comprehensive
  data-driven testing.

  * Database Interaction: It lacks the capability to directly interact
  with databases, making it
  unable to validate database-related functionalities.

  * Dynamic Web Applications: Selenium IDE struggles with handling
  dynamic components within web-based applications, potentially
  leading to inaccuracies in testing results.

  * No Screenshot Capture on Failures: Unlike some other testing tools,
  Selenium IDE doesn’t offer built-in functionality to automatically
  capture screenshots when a test case fails, potentially hindering
  troubleshooting.

  * No Result Report Generation: Selenium IDE lacks the feature to
  generate comprehensive   result reports, making it challenging to
  review and share detailed testing outcomes.

* ACTIVE How to Install Selenium IDE?
SCHEDULED: <2023-11-08 Wed>
* ACTIVE Installing Selenium IDE in Firefox
