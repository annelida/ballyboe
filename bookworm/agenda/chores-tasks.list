Twice a week you should remove all redundant trash out from your
workspace:
- All unrelevant tabs in Chrome browser (10 might be left only);
- All outdated and unused buffers in Emacs.
  - Note taken on [2023-10-13 Fri 12:55] \\

  * When finished press 'x' to commit changes.

  * C-x C-b to list all buffers
  * k to mark buffers for kill (D appears next to buffer)
