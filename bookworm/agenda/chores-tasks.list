- Note taken on [2024-01-24 Wed 18:00] \\
  When you have in your unstage area more than 100 chunks to commit it
  is difficult to cope with pile of work.

  Premise: *You can only control what you see.*

  So it is vital important to organize work space in some particular
  way. So, use split window vertically and follow mode for this purpose.
