  When you have in your unstage area more than 100 chunks to commit it
  is difficult to cope with pile of work.

  Premise: *You can only control what you see.*

  So it is vital important to organize work space in some particular
  way. So, use split window vertically and follow mode for this purpose.

necessary to do after some changes need to be shared with me
urgently. Before push I can't see any changes, because all them are on
your localhost.

Twice a week you should remove all redundant trash out from your
workspace:
- All unrelevant tabs in Chrome browser (10 might be left only);
- All outdated and unused buffers in Emacs.
  - Note taken on [2023-10-13 Fri 12:55] \\
  
  * Run M-x ibuffer (built-in command).
  * On each line with a buffer you want to delete press 'd'.
  * When finished press 'x' to commit changes.

  * C-x C-b to list all buffers
  * k to mark buffers for kill (D appears next to buffer)
  * x to execute kill
